User Request App

I created this app while working for HealthGrades in Madison, WI.

The system involved contained personal health information of patients in many hospitals accross the USA.
Because we were involved in protecting that data, only certan users were able to gain access to certain tools.
Because of the technical and absolute nature of the requests being used for this purpose, errors were common.
I created this app to eliminate those errors and back-and-forth emails between the requesting party and developers.
Since the end result is only a form to be used to edit the data base it is Create and Delete only (not CRUD).

Phase 2 was another app that would take the JSON objects creted by this app and perform CRUD operations on the data.
I left the company after cmpleting this app for a better job as a C# .NET Software Engineer.

Certain operations have been disabled to avoid confusion for anyone unafmiliar with the purpose of this app.
It was 100% working as expected when completed, but this demo has some limited functionality as stated above.
